        <h1>Jan. 10, 2023: First Asian Act to Headline Coachella</h1>
        <p>Four years after becoming the first K-pop girl group to play Coachella, the festival announced that BLACKPINK
          would be returning to headline the annual music event, making the quartet the first Asian act to do so. The
          group is set to headline on April 15 and 22.</p>

        <h1>Sept. 25, 2022: First K-Pop Girl Group to Top the Billboard 200</h1>
        <p>Girl power! BLACKPINK debuted atop the Billboard 200 dated Oct. 1 (released Sept. 25) with sophomore album
          Born Pink. The eight-song set is the first by an all-female group to top the all-genre chart since Danity
          Kane’s Welcome to the Dollhouse launched at No. 1 on the April 5, 2008, tally. BLACKPINK is the third K-pop
          group to top the chart, following BTS’ Proof and Stray Kids’ mini album Oddinary. But unlike those two
          efforts, Born Pink is mostly in English with some Korean-language lyrics, while the boy bands’ sets are mostly
          in Korean.</p>
